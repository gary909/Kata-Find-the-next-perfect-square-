    <p>
        You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?<br>
        <br>
        Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square <br>
        after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is <br>
        an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.<br>
        <br>
        If the parameter is itself not a perfect square then -1 should be returned. You <br>
        may assume the parameter is non-negative.<br>
        <br>
        Examples:(Input --> Output)<br>
        <br>
        121 --> 144<br>
        625 --> 676<br>
        114 --> -1 since 114 is not a perfect square<br>
